# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
I think they are good they helped with some issues but I still don't think that I have the changes down pat just yet. I had issues with the changes to images and media.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
After fiddiling around with it I think I have the hang of it.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
Yes, you can implement them much like a regular word document that many are familar with. The nav feature makes for moving between pages easier.

* Why is reset.css necessary? 
It allows out of date browsers or technology resize the html file so that it can be viewed.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
I have used IE, firefox, and chrome. I have noticed that and I think that they should standardize some of the features so that sites can be viewed across all of them.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
