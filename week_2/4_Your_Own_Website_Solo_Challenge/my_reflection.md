# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://dakotacousineau.github.io/index

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
I kept it simple because that is what I like the best but had issues with trying to add my personal links for following and was only able to implement twitter. the others requirec java script so hopefully I implement them later.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
I really enjoyed working on my site and want to get some of my other ideas to work. 

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
I drew up a quick sketch to show my work and have some links about me to show myself to the community. then i went to work coding it. i find i work best if i make a change then upload to see if what i did worked.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
i want to get my links for g+, linkedin, and facebook to work.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
no the biggest issue I seem to have is with file paths

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
