# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?
So far my biggest challenge has been staying motivated and not going off on tangents down rabbit holes. I tend to keep clicking on all of the links and then clicking on more links in a never ending spiral. 

* How will you combat that? 
After reading the time managment steps I am going to first try and structure my day more and set time reminders to keep on task. I am also going to start using daily meditation and work outs to try and keep my mind fresh. 

* What techniques will you try? meditation, working out, and timer.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
I want to know as much as possible and be as profecient as possible for when I arrive in Chicago.
