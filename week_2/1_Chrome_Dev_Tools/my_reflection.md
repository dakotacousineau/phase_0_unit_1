# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
Document Object Model is a platfrom that allows for scripts to be updated and presented back for real time view.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
Their site looks neat and concise where mine looks a bit long for what it shows.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
I found working with Code School very frustrating because it would not recongnize my changes but the Web tools themselves where very useful and easy.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
no

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
