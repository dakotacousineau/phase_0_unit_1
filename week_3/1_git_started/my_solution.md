## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
git add is the staging step before git commit. It allows you to track a new file and then puts it to be committed the next time git commit is used.

#### branch
The git branch command allows you to list, create, and delete branches. Git branch by itself will list all of your branches you have. Git branch (branchname) will create a new branch and switch over to it. 

#### checkout
Git checkout allows you to easily change over to a branch. 

#### clone
Git clone is used usually when working on a project with someone else. You run git clone [url of desired directory] and it will copy the entire history of that directory to your local repository so you can start working on it.

#### commit
Git commit is used to take a picture of the changes you have made and staged for the master file. Doing this Git will make a snapshot to record the changes incase you want to revert. 

#### fetch
Git fetch pulls new information and branches from a remote repository. So if you want to update info someone else has made available you can do a fetch and update what you have locally. 

#### log
Git log pulls up a history of commits with the information of when it was commited, by whom, and the description of what changes were listed. 

#### merge
Git merge will merge the branch you have been working in with the master branch. This allows multiple people to work on a project and then merge them together. 

#### pull
Git pull does two things first it does a Git fecth to pull an updated file and then merges it together with the previous file. 

#### push
Git push moves the changes you made locally to the remote server. So if someone tries to pull or fecth from that server they will get the updated file. 

#### reset
Git reset can unstage a file if you do not want to commit it. It can revert a file back to a certain point or it can revert all the way back to the last commit.

#### rm
Git rm removes a file from the staging area similar to git reset head but it removes it permently. 

#### status
Git status lets you see if anything has been changed since your last commit.

- Fetch changes
- Commit locally

## Release 5: Errors you encountered
1. Error
2. Solution
3. Cause (explain the error)

## Release 6: Reflection
I did not know all of the command line information before. It makes what I was doing in saving my files and pushing them using the Git Hub app look kind of bad. So everyone can see all of the silly mistakes I made because I am the type of person who likes to try things and go does this work. No ok how but this. Oh that kinda works lets tweak this and see what that does. So I commit A LOT.
