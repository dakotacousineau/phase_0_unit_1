## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Assuming you have created an account on your profile page you are going to click the tab that says Repositories in the middle of the page. On the right side you will see a green button that says New. Click on it. This is the page to set up your repositories information. You are going to need to name it, select if it is public or private and then select which license you want to apply on your repository. 

Open source means that the code is free for anyone to download, edit, distribute or do what they want with it. You have no rights over anyone else. 

Open source I think is a great idea but in application in a capitolist society it is limited. It does make me nervous to lose control of information that I made and others can profit off of. I do think it is an utopian idea. It is simialar to the guy that discovered penecillian. He refused to patten his discovery because doing so would hinder its use costing lives. He gave up the millions he could have made on a patten to let it go to those in need. 

Using a license protects your rights as well as notifying the user what they can and can not do legally with that code. If they use your code to break a law you are not responsible, and if they use your code for profit and it is not listed as such then you have can pursue legal discourse. 

Going over it again I was much more familiar with the information on how to do actions.
