Blog url: http://dakotacousineau.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

The blog was definatly helpful in going over and applying some of the info again and practice makes perfect. It still isn't as good as I would like it to be but I figure we are probably going to use the code again and I can tweak it for the better next time.
