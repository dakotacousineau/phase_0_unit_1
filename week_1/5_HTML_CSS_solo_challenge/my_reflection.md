I mostly went over the example code used and then put it in my website updating the colors and pictures ect. 

I had trouble with psuedo classes like hover

It is all pretty much new to me and I used the example material pretty heavily.

I really like seeing my work in action and loading the site.

None of it was tedious as it is still new.
