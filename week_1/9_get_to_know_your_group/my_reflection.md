Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

I feel so much better that everyone else was having the same concerns I was having. I also feel very much releaved after hearing the fireside chat. I am super pumped to get this next week started and just dominate the assignments. I think it is going to be the first step down a very happy path and this DBC is going to be one of those moments you talk about when your old on how your life changed because of one decision.
