## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I had issues with deleting a old repository but found instructions on how and did so. 

Git is local it exists on your computer only. GitHub is on an external server similar to the cloud. 

Version control is the updates you and your team makes to a file. GitHub helps because it allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time and then merges the changes into a single document. It also allows you to see what changes where made, by whom, and revert to an older file if needed. 

Yes, it does make sense to have copies of your old information after you apply changes. Nothing is more frustrating then making a change to a document only to realize you made a mistak and your information is gone. 

I am not sure on the advantages of working in Git as opposed to GitHub. Why not just make all of your information stored safely on an external server?
